Here are some potential aggregations and data points you can use to create a dashboard for the supplier management service:

1. **Total Number of Suppliers**
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/supplier/all`
   - Aggregation: Count of all suppliers.

2. **Suppliers by Status**
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/supplier/all`
   - Aggregation: Group suppliers by their status (e.g., active, inactive).

3. **Total Number of Work Orders**
   - Endpoint: Create a new endpoint in `WorkOrderController` to get the count of all work orders.
   - Aggregation: Count of all work orders.

4. **Work Orders by Client**
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/workorder/by-client/{clientId}`
   - Aggregation: Group work orders by client ID.

5. **Work Orders by Service Type**
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/workorder/by-service`
   - Aggregation: Group work orders by service type.

6. **Work Orders by Status**
   - Endpoint: Create a new endpoint in `WorkOrderController` to get work orders grouped by status.
   - Aggregation: Group work orders by their status (e.g., pending, completed).

7. **Upcoming Work Orders**
   - Endpoint: Create a new endpoint in `WorkOrderController` to get work orders with due dates in the next 30 days.
   - Aggregation: Filter work orders by due date.

8. **Suppliers Onboarded Over Time**
   - Endpoint: `/api/v1/supplier/all`
   - Aggregation: Group suppliers by their onboarding date to show trends over time.

9. **Work Orders by Project Manager**
   - Endpoint: Create a new endpoint in `WorkOrderController` to get work orders grouped by project manager.
   - Aggregation: Group work orders by project manager.

10. **Average Time to Complete Work Orders**
    - Endpoint: Create a new endpoint in `WorkOrderController` to calculate the average time from start date to due date for completed work orders.
    - Aggregation: Calculate the average duration of completed work orders.

These data points can be used to create a comprehensive dashboard to monitor the supplier management service's performance and operations.
